# 3D-Heat-Equation-Simulation-Example-for-Partial-Differential-Equations
This repository contains a Python example for solving the 3D heat equation using the explicit finite difference method . The code shows the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) in a 3D sphere with Dirichlet boundary conditions.  This project was created for مجمع اللغة العربية as part of a mathematical terminology project.
